oops, I haven't posted anything in a while!

Here are some project goals I would like to accomplish in the near future:

1. See if I can create a more efficient floodfill algorithm for funSketch. Try to run some tests to compare!
2. Improve my HTML piano roll. Maybe try using web workers to handle the note playback, so that it doesn't lag/freeze when scrolling horizontally.
3. Get a good understanding of WebGL, and maybe make some games with WebGL!
4. Improve boringChat! Add the logout feature, and an edit-profile page perhaps.
5. Play with Jekyll some more.

good luck!
